# Ansible "Simple" Collection
This collection is intended to house the small roles I've created to do various things.

Roles here are not meant to be incredibly feature rich, nor support a wide variety of platforms. Rather, the goal of these roles is just to get something up quick and configured in a somewhat-sane way. More featureful roles will be moved into their own repo, and managed traditionally.

## Docs
The `docs/` folder contains information on the included roles, and their supported platforms and variables.
